				<H1>Waving Hands from <I>Duel Purpose</I></H1>

				A game by Richard Bartle.

					A number of years ago, Richard Bartle published a zine called <U>Sauce of
				the Nile</U>. One feature I particularly liked was the rules for new games which he
				produced. One game appealed to me more than the others but it never seemed to
				achieve the fame it deserved. Since then Richard has rewritten some of its rules
				and has tried to have it produced commercially but, as his proposed publishers
				have been using delaying tactics for some time now, he has given me permission
				to reprint the game. The original name of the game was Spellbinder but, as that
				name has been used in a commercial game since Richard thought of it, he told me
				to think up some other name. The game is a rarity as it can be classed as a
				<B>fairy game</B> which is totally dependent upon skill!

				<H2>Introduction</H2>

					This is a game concerning the imaginary conflict between two powerful
				wizards in a duel of sorcery. The two opponents perform magical gestures with
				their hands to create their supernatural weapons - spells. Some spells are so potent
				as to be able to blind a man, call forth terrifying creatures, or even kill the
				unfortunate victim instantly. Consequently, each wizard must rely on his own
				cunning to be able to time enough defensive spells to avoid the brunt of his
				adversary's attack, yet deliver sufficient offensive spells of his own to
				crack the magical armour of his opponent, and kill the wizard outright.

				The game is an attempt to capture the spirit of such a battle in as simple yet
				exciting way as possible. The only equipment needed is pencil, paper and
				opponent. Time taken varies between 15 - 30 minutes. The inventor wishes to
				state that he has never been involved in a magical duel but would be interested
				to discover how realistic the game is for those who have been involved in
				such a bout.

				<H2>The Turn</H2>
				Each turn both player's will write down in secret the directions for their wizards
				and the monsters under their wizards control.  After both players have written
				their directions for this turn, the moves are revealed at the same time and
				dealt with as if the actions specified therein occur simultaneously. Certain spells
				may alter these  circumstances. For example, you don't get to see all of your
				opponent's moves if their wizard is invisible.

				Each turn a player's wizard can either gesture with their hands to weave part of a
				spell, stab with their knife, or do nothing. They use both hands and each hand can act
				independently or in concord with the other.

				Monsters will obey their master's commands exactly. Monster's may change hands
				(as it were) as a result of enchantment. From that point on the monster's attacks
				are directed by the new master. Monsters may make a single attack each turn against
				a target chosen by their master or they may spend the turn doing nothing. Monsters
				may attack on the turn in which they are summoned.

				Monsters are untrained, unintelligent creatures and can neither gesture nor cast spells.
				Players personally acquainted with monsters who wish to vouch for their ability to cast
				spells are requested to keep quiet.

				<H2>Gestures</H2>

				Spells are created by strings of gestures made with the hands. There are
				five single-handed gestures:
				<UL><LI>the wiggled fingers (F)</LI>
				<LI>the proferred palm (P)</LI>
				<LI>the snap (S) </LI>
				<LI>the wave (W) </LI>
				<LI>the digit pointing (D) </LI>
				</UL>

				There is one two-handed gesture: the clap (C). Both hands must be specified as
				clapping in the same turn for this gesture to be valid.

				There also two non-gestures:
				<UL><LI>stab (stab)</LI>
				<LI>nothing ( )</LI>
				</UL>

				The abbreviation for each gesture (or non-gesture) is used when specifing directions
				for the turn.

				Spells are cast using an ordered series of gestures. A list of spells
				and the gestures used to cast them is given in the final section. For
				example, three wiggling finger gestures on consecutive turns (noted as F-F-F)
				evokes a <B>paralysis</B> spell. The uniqueness of the game, however, is that
				a single gesture in more than one series and, hence, can be used to cast
				more than one spell. Gestures may be used in multiple series provided that:
				<UL><LI>the gestures have been made in the correct sequence without interruption</LI>
				<LI>no more than one spell is created per gesture</LI>
				<LI>all gestures for one spell are made with the same hand</LI>
				</UL>

				For instance, the left hand could cast the F-F-F above. In the following four
				turns the left hand could gesture (S-S-D-D) to finish off a <B>fireball</B> spell
				since the last five gestures would then be (F-S-S-D-D). Another alternative is to
				simply perform another (F) for a second <B>paralysis</B> spell, as the last three gestures
				are still (F-F-F). If spells are used in a wise manner and frequently overlap,
				the overall number of gestures needed to cast them can be cut dramatically.

				If a gesture can be construed to create two or more spells then the caster
				chooses which one to cast. For example, the last two gestures of a <B>finger
				of death</B> are the same as <B>missile</B>, yet only on odd occasions would the
				latter spell be chosen in preference to the former.

				Another example of the one-spell-per-gesture concept is the following: <br><br>

					Right hand:     P P W S    Last 4 gestures form <B>invisibility</B><br>
					Left hand:      W W W S    Last 3 gestures form <B>counter-spell</B><br><br>


				The trouble here is the <B>invisibility</B> spell needs both hands to perform
				certain gestures. However, since the final S of the left hand cannot be used to
				cast two spells, it is clear that a choice must be made between the W-W-S of the
				<B>counter-spell</B> and the P-P-(w-(s of the <B>invisibility</B>.
				Here and in the rest of the document an open parenthesis, followed by a lowercase
				letter, denotes a gesture to be performed with <EM>both hands</EM> simultaneously.
				E.g. (w denotes a W by each hand.<br><br>

				If the caster completes a series that casts a spell, intentionally or unintentionally,
				the spell must be cast. Most of these are shot off to nowhere if not required but
				some cannot be easily discarded. For example <B>fire storm</B> gets you no matter
				where it is released. Note also that some of the larger spells have smaller
				ones incorporated within their casting series.<br><br>

				All spells and monsters need a target, someone or something to  be the victim.
				Usually the target is obvious. Normally enchantments and  damaging spells are
				cast at on your opponent's wizard, whereas protection and summonning
				spells are cast on your wizard. However, if your target is not the usual
				one, it must be noted along with the gestures. For example, you may wish to cast a
				<B>counter-spell</B> on your own monster to stop a <B>charm monster</B> spell
				from making it attack you. The target need not exist at the time the gestures
				are made. "The elemental he's about to create" is a valid target but if it still
				doesn't exist when you actually cast the spell then the spell is discarded
				(but, once again, recall that certain spells <EM>cannot</EM> be discarded).
				Monsters will usually attack their master's opponent but if the target is different,
				e.g. another monster, then it must be written down along with the monster's action.<br><br>

					Spells can be aborted at any point during their development simply by
				performing a gesture which breaks up the series for that spell.
				There is no penalty, save having wasted some time. Note that no
				spells contain <B>stab</B> or <B>nothing</B>. Also note that nonsense (Zen?)(
				gestures such as (C with just one hand are considered the same as <B>nothing</B>
				(which is a fairly Zenlike concept, in and of itself).
				Consequently, after one of these options is taken, all spells must start
				from scratch. Note also that wizards carry only one dagger and so cannot stab
				with both hands at the same time. Wizards can, however, change hands for stabbing
				without wasting time. Such are the disadvantages of physical violence.<br><br>

				Certain spells cancel one another if they take effect simultaneously. An
				obvious example is <B>finger of death</B> and <B>raise dead</B>.
				Cancellation occurs when the subjects of the spells concerned are the same,
				although there are some of the heat versus cold variety which don't care who is
				the subject. Most other spells which cancel harmlessly are contradictory enchantments
				(e.g. a wizard cannot both repeat last turn's gestures and give a random gesture
				with one hand when <B>amnesia</B> and  <B>confusion</B> are cast at the same time).
				If two spells seem to cancel yet are not mentioned explicitly in the section on spells,
				use your common sense and you can't go far wrong (henceforth this will be known
				as the <B>Cosmic Encounter Rule</B>).<br><br>

					Since spells detonate simultaneously, there is occasionally confusion
				over spells which don't cancel yet which seem to depend on which happened
				first. The best example is when a monster is created and, on the same turn, hit
				by a <B>fireball</B>, or something else sufficient to kill it. Since both are
				simultaneous, the monster will attack that turn whilst being destroyed. There
				are some examples explicitly mentioned in the final section. For example,
				ice elementals in an <B>ice storm</B> and <B>counter-spell</B> or
				<B>dispel magic</B> versus all other spells.<br><br>

				Another seeming conflict occurs when a target that is resistant to fire has both
				a <B>remove enchantment</B> and <B>fireball</B> cast on them. The enchantment
				is removed as the fireball explodes (since they are simultaneous) hence the poor
				victim is fried. If the target were not resistant to fire and was hit by a
				<B>resist fire</B> and <B>fireball</B> then they would start to resist fire just as
				the fireball exploded and be saved.<br><br>

				Before the battle commences, the referee casts a <B>dispel magic</B>
				followed by an <B>anti-spell</B> at each of the wizards so they cannot
				commence gesturing prematurely in order to nearly finish a spell when they
				start the battle. For the same reason, being made resistant to fire in your
				last battle doesn't do you any good in the next.<br><br>

				<H2>Winning</H2>

					Each wizard can sustain fourteen points of damage but dies when fifteen or
				more points of damage are done. The surviving wizard (if any) is declared the winner.
				Simultaneous death is a posthumous draw. Damage to wizards and monsters is
				cumulative (so you don't have to do it all in one go!).
				Dead monsters take no further part in the game.
				Wizards may also choose to surrender. This is not a spell, but a pair of P gestures
				made by both hands at the same time signals your surrender.</p>
